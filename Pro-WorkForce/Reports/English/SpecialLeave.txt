Dear Mr. "Employee name"

I kindly request you to work on deducting the “number of days” from the salary of Mr. “Employee name” due to the fact that he received special 
departures amounting to the “number of hours of departures”, provided that the remainder of the departures are credited, noting that his leave balance
for the year “year” is zero.
